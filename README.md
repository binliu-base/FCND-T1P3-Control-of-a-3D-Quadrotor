# FCND-Term1-P3-3D-Quadrotor-Controller
Udacity Flying Car Nanodegree - Term 1 - Project 3 - 3D Quadrotor Controller

### 1. Project Overview
Goal of this project is to design and implement a cascade controller, which control the drone 
to find the sequance of propeller turn rates so that the drone to fly the desired 3D trajectory.

The project is in two parts. First, We using the Python/Unity simulator environment for rapid prototyping of the desired controller architecture. 
Once it meet the requirements for a working controller, then we migrate that control architecture to a C++ project containing real vehicle code.
Finally, We test the C++ code controller with another simulator that udacity provided, provides a higher fidelity model of the real vehicle this code would be running on.
